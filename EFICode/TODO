TODO:
-change constants
 -pin values
 -ENSURE CONVERSION OF ADC's are correct!!!!
  -for example, due to 5V to 3v3 conversion circuitry for *SOME* ADC lines,
   the value at the ADC will be: = (1023 / 3.3) * ((5v value) * (.68027) > 3.3) ? 3.3 : (5v value) * (.68027)
      ^^^^^ for this reason we are losing the highest ~3% of values (about 110kPa and up for MPX4115A)

-Data.cpp
 -change the 'values' struct to a string that is to be sent to serial print
 -have data be sent back after every injection?
-micros() ROLLS OVER AT 1hr11min!!!!
  -account for this in code?


Things to note


VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!!!
 TEENSY 3.6 IS 3.3V LOGIC, NOT 5V like Arduino!!
 ******THINGS TO ENSURE********
 -TPS has V+ attached to 3.3v rail!!


----ADC STUFF----
-for all Analog to Digital Conversions
 -a 1.2V Vref is available to check ADC accuracy if necessary
 -speed of ADC is variable as well (can be made an interrupt even)
 -can have the ADC take consecutive conversions and averege them if necessary
   -change this if ADC is very volatile between conversions
Truncated ADC's
-MAP (A16)
-O2  (1: A15 2: A14)
-FPS (Fuel pressure?) (A17)
1:1 Converted ADC's
-TPS (A13)
-ECT (A19) and IAT (A18)
 -these are bit different since they are thermisters,
  and we instead measure resistance to find temp


Constants
-Stoicometric ratio vs efficiency?
-Constant Adjustments of Injection Time
 -throttleAdjustment = 1 + TDS^2   (THIS MAY BE AN ERROR IN THE CODE, SHOULD the calculation incorporate DTPS?)
    makes us inject more when we are speeding up, amount by which we
    inject more seems very arbitrary (make this a lookup table)
 -startupModifier = 1.00
    no increase in injection time for first few cycles
 -constModifier = 1.10
    fudge factor
